What does this project contain ?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This project contain python modules,data and meta-data files that help create a movie page 
consisting of movie images, which can be clicked on to play the actual movies.

The python modules are -

movie.py
media.py
fresh_tomatoes.py

The data/meta-data files are -

movies.csv
movie_page.props

In addition, I have enclosed a sample output [sample_output.gif] created when I ran this project in 
my environment.

How to run this project ?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To run it as is, copy all the files in it into a directory of your choice, which your python interpeter can see. 
Run the movie.py module in your environment.  If everything works you should see an output similar 
to sample_output.jpg in your browser and from there on, it is intuitive. Most importantly if you want to see
who the hero is, the story line or the release year of the movie, hover over the images.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
How to customize this project ?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You could customize this project in 2 ways -
1.  Open the movies.csv, read the comments and blow away my movie content and enter your movie 
content [one movie per line], save and run the project again. You should see your movies, instead 
of mine.
2. You could change the title of the movie page, by changing the movie_page.props file
and using your title as opposed to mine.
